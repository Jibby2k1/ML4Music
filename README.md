Filter Investigation outlines the investigation into using filters as a fundamental component of all signal processing (and therefore, machine learning applications). Specifically, we detail how to use the scipy.signal library to develop filters. As previously mentioned, these are fundamental components for even machine learning applications, making them essential to understand and implement. We discuss topics on how to simulate filters, and how to program them onto an FPGA.
